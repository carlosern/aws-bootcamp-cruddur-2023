# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### Watched Chirag's Week 0 - Spend Considerations

I just created a new AWS Account for this Bootcamp

The first I did was watch a video recommendation about how to control the costs of an AWS Account

I enabled the MFA for the Root user, created a new AIM user with the role Admin, and enabled the MFA too.

I followed some instructions about granting granular policies to access Billing Dashboard for my new admin user.

I turned on all the options in the Billing Preferences: Receive PDF Invoice By Email, Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts, and Receive Billing Alerts.

I created a new Cost Budget using the new Templates, specifically the Zero spend budget template, with a Budget amount of $1.00

I created two alerts, one that checks for Actual cost > $0.01, and the other for Forecasted cost > 80%.

After watching Chirag's Week 0 - Spend Considerations, I  created a Billing Alarm following his recommendations

Now I feel calm about the costs


### Watched Ashish's Week 0 - Security Considerations

I watched the tips from Ashish's video, and I only took in consideration de MFA security, which I already had enabled. 

The other services such as AWS Organization, AWS Organization SCP, AWS Cloud Trail I would take into account for a more mature AWS Account in the future
