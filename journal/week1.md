# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

# Required Homework


# Homework Challenges

### Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script
  - I did the following:
      - Created a sh script in the root of the backend project called _start.sh_
      - Updated de Dockerfile: add a COPY command to copy the _start.sh_ file to the container. The same way as requirements.txt is copied
      - Updated the CMD command as follow CMD sh _start.sh_
      - The container works OK

### Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier)
  - I was able to push the images created in gitpod to my dockerhub account. First, I had to create the images with the syntax user/image, I tagged it carlosern/backend and carlosern/front just for testing

### Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
  - I researched about health checks in Docker, and founded this very informative post  [How (and Why) to Add Health Checks to Your Docker Containers](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-and-why-to-add-health-checks-to-your-docker-containers/)
  - I was able to set a heltcheck for the backend-flask container

 ## Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces
  - I already have Docker Desktop on my local machine
  - I pulled images carlosern/front and carlosern/backend  from my dockerhub repository
  - The backend works without changes
  - The fronted needs to get an updated ENV VAR for my localhost, something like this

  ```
  docker run -p 3000:3000 -d -e REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL='http://127.0.0.1:4567' carlosern/front
  ```

- Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
