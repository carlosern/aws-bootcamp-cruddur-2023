# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Create RDS Postgres Instance

I was able to create the RDS instance following the instructional video and with the help of the AW CLI Script

## Create Schema for Postgres

The database schema was created with no problem

## Bash scripting for common database actions

After watching the instructional video, I successfully implemented all the required bash scripts. The experience was highly informative for me

## Connect Gitpod to RDS instance

I successfully connected to the PRD instance, tanto through the Database Explorer extension as well as by using PSQL directly in the terminal

**Create AWS Cognito trigger to insert user into database**

I encountered some issues along the way, but ultimately found a solution that differed from Andrew's final code. Instead, I adapted a function similar to the original one from Bayko that worked better for me.

## Create new activities with a database insert

I found that this activity delved quite deeply into the complexities of connecting a Python app to a relational database, requiring a fair amount of troubleshooting. While I was able to follow Andrew's lead in solving these issues and ultimately get my app working, one detail remained unresolved: the user handle being sent from the app was set to Andrew's, which of course did not exist in my own database. For now, I have temporarily fixed this issue by hardcoding my own user handle.
